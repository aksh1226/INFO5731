            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it  They are a little steep in price and I must say I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little   x  inch box From the pics I was expecting something about double that size  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value  Well  we are now  days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that  x  box it came in  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square  To be honest I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together  Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it The quality certainly seems decent I am basing that on the fact that it didnt come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday  On the upside my granddaughter is probably going to love it  She is just  yrs old but will probably get it back in the box in  minutes So I guess what I am reluctantly saying is that I think the entertainment value is there  I still have  days to get some help probably from a kid with getting this back in the box it came in  Otherwise I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box  so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult  But I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius ok maybe exaggerating there DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else  If they werent so darn expensive I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self  😜EDIT     I did order a second one for myself and company Mind you I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas  Today is the th of January and so we maybe had it opened  weeks  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike however it is tearing apart at one of the seams  So frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending  on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer  After only  weeks it is clear this one is not going to last much longer  I guess on the upside  is really pretty cheap entertainment these days when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling eating out or any other activity  We probably did get at least  worth of entertainment but still 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

Its ability to transform into various shapes has captivated my family member's attention, encouraging both creativity and engagement. The quality and durability of the materials used make it perfect for repetitive use, and the calming effect it has had is truly remarkable.

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",

            "I am new to fidgets and saw a YouTube video of a woman showing this Shashibo cube. I knew I had to have it. I searched on Amazon and this was the only product that was great. However, it is kind of expensive $35 and I got 2 but well worth the money (the vid also said the same thing). I got (red) optical illusion and the blue planet on June 14, 2021, and received it on Jun. 26, 2021. I was freaking out and played with it immediately. I couldn't let it go. It's super satisfying fidgeting with it, the colors, clicking, and the different shapes it makes. I have been playing with the red one more than the blue as it was used to make a bigger structure but found out that you don't really play with them both at the same time. When you are done with 1 shape you just add the 2nd shape to it. I have been showing this fidget to everyone. My husband hates fidgets and things that constantly make clicking noises. One time I went to church with my husband, on our way back home, we had an argument and instead of me being irrational & freaking out and yelling, I took out my fidget and started fidgeting, after he was done talking there was silence (I am still fidgeting at this point to the end of convo), I then replied in a calm, respectful, polite manner (which btw never happens, until now) to him. He looked at my fidget and said hmm, there might be a positive to this fidget. I am super happy, satisfied, and content. Fidgets are great for children/teens/ppl with anxiety and ADD/ADDHD/ADHD, stress and honestly, everyone can benefit from it with or without a disability. I just got 1 for my step-daughter and will in the future buy one for my 3 grandkids (1 coming) However, I have an OCD component to my ADD and do try my best to not buy all fidgets that I see. I do see a lot of vids with teens/children/adults having massive fidget collections, I would be careful to not go overboard with it. It is addicting for all ages. I didn't know this before till now but there is such a thing as name brand fidgets. I bought no-name ones from Amazon (China), and they don't work properly and can break. When you buy the name brand it works correctly, is more expensive, and is quality-made. There are pros and cons to all fidgets but if your child/teen needs to, they should. It helps to calm, comfort, get rid of stress and anxiety also get rid of all/most background noises/thoughts such as stimming for autism.\n",

            "I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She loves this kind of thing and I thought she would enjoy it.  They are a little steep in price and I must say, I was a bit surprised when it arrived in a tiny little 2.5  x 2.5 inch box, (From the pics, I was expecting something about double that size).  I wanted to be certain I was getting a decent quality item, so I removed it from the box and started messing around with it to check quality and entertainment value.  Well,  we are now 3 days closer to Christmas since it arrived and I am no closer to getting back into that 2.5 x 2.5 box it came in.  It is ridiculous how many times I have tried to fold it back into a tiny little square!  To be honest, I simply feel frustrated with the whole damn thing.  I even had ideations of tearing it apart and gluing it back together.  (Then I remembered what I paid and I thought better of it.) The quality certainly seems decent. I am basing that on the fact that it didn't come apart yet and I think I have folded it every which way to Sunday.  On the upside, my granddaughter is probably going to love it!  She is just 9 yrs old, but will probably get it back in the box in 5 minutes!! So, I guess what I am reluctantly saying, is that I think the entertainment value is there.  I still have 20 days to get some help (probably from a kid!) with getting this back in the box it came in.  Otherwise, I will find a new box to wrap it in and keep the old box - so I can show the granddaughter how it looked when I got it.  It is a little embarrassing that I have found this to be so difficult.  But, I am trying to be transparent here and forewarn you that UNLESS you have some help from a genius (ok maybe exaggerating there), DO NOT take it out of the box to try it out if it is a gift for someone else!  If they weren't so darn expensive, I would have simply just ordered another one and kept this one for my dumb self.  😜EDIT:  01/24/23  - I did order a second one for myself (and company) Mind you, I did not even get it out until several days after Christmas.  Today is the 24th of January and so we maybe had it opened 3 weeks.  It has been played with quite a bit by kids and adults alike, however it is tearing apart at one of the seams.  So, frankly we are a bit disappointed for spending $20 on something we thought we would enjoy a bit longer.  After only 3 weeks, it is clear this one is not going to last much longer.  I guess on the upside, $20 is really pretty cheap entertainment these days, when you consider the cost of going to a movie or bowling, eating out or any other activity.  We probably did get at least $20 worth of entertainment, but still. 😢\n",
